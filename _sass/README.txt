# Grey Matter Prototyping

## greymatter.scss
The master CSS file that contains all of Oomph's default Scaffold, as well as patterns for Prototyping. 

Link to your project-specific files in here. 


## Oomph-Scaffold
A copy of the latest stable Scaffold tagged release. 


## Prototyping (folder)
This is meant to hold onto useful wireframe starter styles for common components as well as repeatable navigation patterns. The intent is to download the Oomph Scaffold alongside this folder, and you can get started with the minimum styles needed to run the sample site and demo some components. 


## Refills (folder)
The Refills SASS folder contains styles organized by the name of the component. The same components are available in the `refills_html` folder, but obviously contain only the HTML and necessary Javascript. Include these files in your project wherever you want to use them. 

All SASS is included and rendered in the `prototyping.scss` file as a SASS glob: `@include 'prototyping/*`
