  <p>Your use of the Site may involve the opportunity for you to purchase special deals (<strong>“Blue365 Deals,”</strong> as described herein) for the products and services of third party vendors and suppliers (<strong>“Blue365 Vendors”</strong>). As a condition of purchase, we require your permission to send you administrative e-mails regarding your account activity, such as password re-setting, responses to your inquiries, and your purchases. We may also send you promotional e-mails with updates about products, services, and offers. You can opt-out of our promotional e-mails anytime by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our promotional e-mails. By placing an order with respect to a specific Blue365 Deal, you make an offer to purchase products or services you have selected based on standard restrictions, Blue365 Vendor-specific restrictions, the terms and conditions stated in this Agreement, and applicable law.</p>
  <p>You are required to create an account in order to purchase any product or service from the Site. An account is required in order that we can validate your Blue Company affiliation as well as to provide you with the ability to select favorite deals, modify your preferences, and our compliance with applicable law. Neither BCBSA nor any of its independent, local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Companies (each a <strong>“Blue Company,”</strong> and collectively, <strong>“Blue Companies”</strong>), nor any of our or their respective affiliates, contractors, agents, consultants, or other third parties (collectively, the <strong>“BCBSA Group”</strong>) involved with creating, managing, operating, or otherwise assisting with the Site, assume any responsibility for the products or services for which promotion codes (<strong>“Promo Codes”</strong>) may be redeemed or coupons (<strong>“Coupons”</strong>) used.</p>
  <p>As part of or in connection with creating your account and accessing Blue365 Deals and other material and information on the Site, you authorize BCBSA to share your information (including your name, e-mail address, Blue Company affiliation and other information) with your Blue Company and Blue365 Vendors.

  <p>The BCBSA Group does not make any warranty to End Users for the quality, safety, usability, or other aspect of any product or service for which a Promo Code is redeemed or a Coupon used. All End Users are members of a Blue Company that participates in the Blue365 Program. Some services or products for which Promo Codes can be redeemed or Coupons used may cause bodily harm, and for such services or products, the BCBSA Group does not assume any responsibility or liability to the End User.

  <h3 id="dmca">13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”).</h3>

If you have a concern regarding the use of copyrighted material on the Site, please contact BCBSA at Blue365 Member Services, 225 North Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL 60601-7680, or alternately, you may send such concern via e-mail to: <a href="mailto:support@blue365deals.com">support@Blue365deals.com</a>. The DMCA specifies that all infringement claims must be in writing (either electronic mail or paper letter) and must include the following: (a) a physical or electronic signature of the copyright holder or a person authorized to act on his or her behalf; (b) a description of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; (c) a description of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material; (d) information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address; (e) a statement that the you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
  <p>Upon receipt of a properly filed complaint satisfying the requirements of the DMCA, we will remove or block access to the allegedly infringing material, and may terminate the End User’s account per these Terms of Use. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed, you may submit a counter-notice to BCBSA at Blue365 Member Services, 225 North Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL 60601-7680, or alternately, you may send the counter-notice via e-mail to: <a href="mailto:support@blue365deals.com">support@Blue365deals.com</a>. If we receive a valid counter notification, the DMCA provides that the removed or blocked information may be restored or access re-enabled. We may replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it in not less than ten (10) business days following receipt of the counter notification, unless we first receive notice from the complaining party that such complaining party has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Site.</p>
  
  <h3 id="monitoring">14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monitoring.</h3>
  <p>BCBSA directly or indirectly through others of the BCBSA Group shall have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the content of the Site at all times, including any ratings and comments that may now or hereinafter be included as part of the Site, to determine compliance with this Agreement and any operating rules established by any of the BCBSA Group, as well as to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, or authorized government request.&nbsp; Without limiting the foregoing, BCBSA directly or indirectly through others of the BCBSA Group shall have the right to remove any material that BCBSA, in its sole discretion, finds to be in violation of the provisions hereof or otherwise objectionable.</p>

  <p>End User acknowledges that all discussion for ratings, comments, and/or other message or communication facilities (collectively, <strong>“Group(s)”</strong>) are public and not private communications, and that, therefore, others may read End User’s communications without End User’s knowledge. The BCBSA Group does not control or endorse the content, messages, or information found in any Group, and, therefore, the BCBSA Group specifically disclaims any liability concerning the Groups and any actions resulting from End Users participation in any Group, including any objectionable content. Generally, any communication which End User posts to any part of the Site (whether in ratings or comments) is considered to be non-confidential. If particular web site pages permit the submission of communications that will be treated by any of the BCBSA Group as confidential, that fact will be stated on those particular web site pages. By posting comments, messages, or other information on the Site, End User grants each of the BCBSA Group the right to use such comments, messages, or information for promotions, advertising, market research, or any other lawful purpose. For more information, see our Privacy Policy.</p>
  
  <h3 id="indemnification">16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indemnification.&nbsp;</h3>
  <p>End User agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless each of the BCBSA Group (including BCBSA) and its and their affiliates and respective directors, officers, employees, and agents, from and against all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, cost or debt, and expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising from (a) End User’s use of or access to the Site and/or the Third Party Sites, (b) End User’s violation of any provisions of this Agreement, (c) End User’s violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right, or (d) any claim that any communications or other Content submitted by End User causes damage to a third party.

  <h3 id="release">17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reservation of Rights and Release.&nbsp;</h3>
  <p>BCBSA reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or take any action BCBSA deems appropriate regarding disputes that End User may have with other customers of ours or with any Blue365 Vendor. To the extent the law permits, End User releases each of the BCBSA Group from any claims or liability related to any communications or other Content posted on the Site and from any claims related to the conduct of any other customers or other End Users or Vendor. You hereby waive California Civil Code § 1542 (if you are a California resident), and any similar provision in any other jurisdiction (if you are a resident of such jurisdiction), which states: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”</p>
  
  <h3 id="termination">18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Termination.</h3>
  <p>BCBSA may terminate this Agreement or your access to and use of the Site at any time. Without limiting the foregoing, any of the BCBSA Group shall have the right to immediately terminate any passwords or accounts of End User in the event of any conduct by End User which any of the BCBSA Group, in its sole discretion, considers to be unacceptable, or in the event of any breach by End User of this Agreement, or for other reasons at its sole discretion. <i>Sections 2 through 12 and 15 through 33</i> shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
  
  <h3 id="thirdparty">19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third Party Content.</h3>
  <p>Each of the BCBSA Group, similar to an Internet Service Provider, is a distributor (and not a publisher) of content supplied by individual Blue365 Vendors and other third parties and End Users. Accordingly, BCBSA and the others of the BCBSA Group have no more editorial control over such content than does a public library, bookstore, or newsstand. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information or content expressed or made available by individual Blue365 Vendors and other third parties, including information providers or any other end users are those of the respective author(s) or distributors, and not of any of the BCBSA Group. Neither BCBSA nor any of the BCBSA Group, nor any third-party provider of information, guarantees the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any Content, nor its merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose. (Refer to <i>Sections 6 and 8</i> above for the complete provisions governing limitation of liabilities and disclaimers of warranty.) In many instances, the Content available through the Site represents the opinions and judgments of the respective information provider, End User, or other user not under contract with any of the BCBSA Group, and none of the BCBSA Group either endorses or is responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice, or statement made on the Site by anyone other than authorized BCBSA employee spokespersons while acting in official capacities. Under no circumstances will any of the BCBSA Group be liable for any loss or damage caused by an End User’s reliance on Content obtained on or through the Site or Third Party Sites. It is the responsibility of each End User to evaluate the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information, opinion, advice, etc. or other content available through the Site and Third Party Sites. The Site contains links to third party web sites maintained by individual Blue365 Vendor and other content providers. These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by any of the BCBSA Group of the contents on such individual Blue365 Vendor and other Third-Party Sites and the BCBSA Group hereby expressly disclaims any representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such individual Blue365 Vendors and Third-Party Sites. If you decide to access linked individual Blue365 Vendor or other Third-Party Sites, you do so at your own risk. None of the BCBSA Group controls, endorses, promotes, or has any affiliation with any other web site unless expressly stated in the Site. Unless you have executed a written agreement with BCBSA expressly permitting you to do so, you may not provide a hyperlink to the Site from any other web site. BCBSA reserves the right to revoke its consent to any link at any time in its sole discretion.</p>
  
  <h3 id="links">20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Links to Other Web Sites.</h3>
