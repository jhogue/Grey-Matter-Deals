    <h3>You will now be leaving Blue365 and visiting our Partner&rsquo;s site.</h3>
    <h4>By clicking the "CONTINUE" button below, I understand the following:</h4>
    <p class="micro">I am leaving the Blue365 website (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) to go to the website of an independent vendor, subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policy of that vendor's website. Blue365 offers access to savings on items that Members may purchase directly from independent vendors, vouchers and coupons which can be used to obtain products and services from independent vendors, and other options to encourage healthy living, all of which are different from items that are covered under your policies with your independent, local Blue Company, its contracts with Medicare, or any other applicable federal healthcare program. To find out what is covered under your policies, call your Blue Company. The products and services described on the Site are neither offered nor guaranteed under your Blue Company's contract with the Medicare program. In addition, they are not subject to the Medicare appeals process. Any disputes regarding these products and services may be subject to your Blue Company's grievance process. Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) may receive payments from Blue365 vendors providing products and services on or accessible through the Site. Neither BCBSA nor any Blue Company recommends, endorses, warrants or guarantees any specific vendor, product or service available under or through the Blue365 Program or Site.</p>
